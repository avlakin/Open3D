About This Project
#######################

Open3D is an open-source library that supports rapid development of software that deals with 3D data. The Open3D frontend exposes a set of carefully selected data structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python. The backend is highly optimized and is set up for parallelization. We welcome contributions from the open-source community.

Although the Open3D project is currently maintained by `Hamdi Sahloul`, it was initiated by `Qianyi Zhou` and `Jaesik Park`, who have wrote `a paper <http://www.open3d.org/paper.pdf>`_, and they ask you to kindly cite it!
